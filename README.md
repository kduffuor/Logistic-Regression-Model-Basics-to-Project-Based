# From Basics to Healthcare: Logistic Regression with Loan Approval and Diabetes Prediction.
A beginner-friendly guide to logistic regression using Python and scikit-learn. Starts with a simple loan approval example to explain the basics, then applies the model to predict diabetes using real healthcare data. Includes evaluation metrics, ROC curve, and a manual input predictor.

## Project Dataset
- **Source**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- **Features**: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age
- **Target**: `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic)

## What it Covers
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Model training using `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn`
- Performance evaluation:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - Accuracy Score
  - ROC Curve
- Manual input prediction system (console-based)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Try It Yourself
Use the manual input block at the end to test your own values and get predictions.
